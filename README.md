# face-shape-detection

This code consists of two main parts, each serving a distinct purpose in the realm of face shape recognition.

Firstly, there's an application designed to recognize face shapes in real-time using a pre-trained deep learning model. The application utilizes the TensorFlow and OpenCV libraries to handle image processing and model loading. It employs a Haar cascade classifier for face detection, enabling it to locate faces within images. The loaded pre-trained model, trained on labeled face shape data, predicts the face shape category of each detected face. This information is then overlaid onto the image, providing a visual representation of the recognized face shapes. The application is presented in a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter, featuring a button to trigger image capture and face shape prediction from a webcam feed.

Secondly, there's a segment focused on training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for face shape classification. This involves importing additional libraries such as Keras and Matplotlib. The dataset is prepared using image data generators with augmentation techniques to enhance the model's ability to generalize. The CNN model architecture is defined, consisting of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is compiled with appropriate loss and optimization functions and then trained on the prepared dataset. The training progress is visualized using Matplotlib, displaying both training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs. Finally, the trained model is saved for future use, facilitating the deployment of the face shape recognition application.

Together, these components form a comprehensive system for face shape recognition, encompassing real-time inference with a pre-trained model and the ability to train and refine models for improved accuracy over time.

Indeed, the code includes an XML file named haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml. This file is essential for face detection within the face shape recognition application. It contains a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier specifically designed for detecting frontal faces in images.

The Haar cascade classifier is a machine learning-based approach used for object detection. It works by analyzing features in an image at different scales and positions to identify regions that may contain the object of interest, in this case, human faces. The classifier has been trained on a large dataset of positive and negative examples of faces to learn discriminative features that help distinguish between face and non-face regions.

In the context of the face shape recognition application, the detect_faces() function utilizes the Haar cascade classifier to detect faces in images captured from a webcam feed. This process is a crucial initial step before the pre-trained deep learning model predicts the face shape of the detected faces. Without accurate face detection, the subsequent face shape recognition process would not be possible. Therefore, the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file plays a vital role in the functionality of the overall system.
